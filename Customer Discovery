Customer Discovery
Drucker’s Five Most Important questions:
What is our purpose?
Who are our customers?

What are our results?
What is our plan?

2) Customer-centric information gathering
⦁	  Get to know the customer
⦁	  Be the customer
⦁	  Establish a connection with the customer
⦁	  Develop a timetable with the customer

3) Scope
  Project scope refers to the defined boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and constraints of a specific project.

Well-Defined Scope provides
Clarity and focus
Minimized Risks
Effective Planning
Stakeholder Satisfaction

In-Scope- project scope outlines the work that needs to be accomplished
Out-of-Scope-project scope outlines what is not included in the project.

4) Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Outputs (ITTO) diagram
   diagram that illustrates the relationships between inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs for project management processes

5) Challenge framing
Is the process of defining the focus of the problem to be resolved

6) Challenge scoping
Is the process of creating a plan that includes organizing and managing the time, people, and other resources required to solve the framed challenge

7) ‘How Might We’ statements- converts a framed challenge into a solvable question
A good HMW statement generates at least five solutions

8) Trade-off- is the act of giving up one thing in return for another

9) Work streams- is a group of tasks and activities to be completed by a team of assembled workgroups

10) Ideation- is the process of generating ideas around specific aspects of the larger design challenge

Customer Discovery Methods

Journey Mapping- Is the process of documenting the experiences and interactions customers have with a business or an organization
Makes documenting the customer experience structured and streamlined
Journey map is composed of:
⦁	Phases

Interview- is for stakeholders and customers to share unfiltered ideas, concerns, and thoughts
Is a quick, easy way to get direct feedback from customers and stakeholders on their current experiences and suggestions for improvement
⦁	Stakeholder Interview
⦁	Customer/ Consumer Interview

Shadowing- involves observing the customer while asking questions about their actions

Embodying- entails living the experiences of stakeholders and customers

Current State- refers to the existing condition of a process at a specific point in time
Key aspects to consider:
⦁	Technology and Tools
⦁	Stakeholder Feedback
⦁	Documentation
⦁	Availability of Resources
⦁	Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

Business Analysts
Collaborates between the business and technology teams of an organization
Performs a variety of tasks related to elicitation, documentation, and analysis of project requirements
Defines business needs of an organization
Gather project requirements from internal and external project stakeholders
Writes buiness cases to outline what, why, how, and who of the project
Review project requests to design the work plan

Wireframes visually break down the processes to depict how processes fit into the business flow
Rely on data-driven metrics to offer insights into business needs
Solves problems identified in the requirements elicitation phase of the process
Creates visual representations of the processes using flowcharts, diagrams, and business maps
Facilitates the UAT phase of the project

Implementation Lifecycle Phases are:
⦁	Analyze
⦁	Build
⦁	Deliver
⦁	Operate

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)- use cases as well as release mgmt and change mgmt
Three development models:
⦁	Change Set development- uses declarative tools. There is no CLI or a version control system
⦁	Org development- SF CLI is used to extract metadata from a development environment and to integrate with a version control system (VCS)
⦁	Package development-different customizations are managed as a separate packages.

Rapid Application Development (RAD)- is an application development model reduces delivery times
⦁	speed 
⦁	user strategy
⦁	prototyping
No-code and low-code solutions

Opposite of the linear Waterfall method that establishes goals for each dev phase sequentially

Release Management
After testing is completed and quality benchmarks are met
The customization can be deployed to production
Employees and partners need to be trained to understand the changes


>Security Health Check
⦁	Gives visibility into an org’s security settings
⦁	Allows identifying and fixing these vulnerabilities in security settings
⦁	Provides a summary score, as well as categorizing security risks into
High, Medium, Low, and Information categories
Helps identifying security settings such as Session Settings, Password Policies, Certificate and Key Mgmt, File Upload, Download Security Settings
Summary score is calculated using a proprietary formula
Up to five custom baselines can be uploaded and used for comparison
Lower score indicates settings at a higher risk
⦁	Excellent- 90% above
⦁	Very Good- 80=89%
⦁	Good- 70-79%
⦁	Poor- 55=69%
⦁	Very Poor- 54% below

Salesforce Optimizer
>Optimizer //runs automatically or on a scheduled basis
Analyzes the org and provides insights, recommendations, and actions related to maintenance, productivity, and adoption
Scan can take up to 24 hours
Is a tool that
⦁	Analyzes the org
⦁	Provides insights
⦁	Recommendations
⦁	Actions related to maintenance
⦁	Productivity
⦁	Technical debt which becomes business debt, can be identified in a timely manner and handled properly

Entity
Helps identify cluttered page layouts, inefficient config
Reports features that are not used or underperforming and provides recommendations to drive usage or increase adoption by maximizing SF capabilities

Org Impact Analysis Report
Report shows how specific changes in the company’s metadata can affect other org metadata and configuration
Third-party apps from AppExchange that can be used for org impact analysis, change analysis, org discovery

Entity Relationship Diagram
Helps stakeholders visualize the objects, fields, relationships

Schema Builder- can be used to understand the relationships among various objects in SF.

Universal Process Notification (UPN)
Is used to create process map that lists who needs to do what, when, why, and how

Capability Model
Visually summarizes the capabilities the product, feature, or organization has

SF Customer 360
Single view of the customer

User Adoption

Long- Term Adoption

SF User Interface Types:

SF Classic UI
Lightning Experience User Interface
⦁	Responsive design
⦁	Fresh look 
⦁	Feel with newer features

Lightning Experience Adoption

Lightning Usage App provides Lightning Exp adoption metrics based on the usage, activity, and security
App Launcher| Lighnting Usage

⦁	Daily and monthly active users in Lightning Exp and the SF mobile app
⦁	Daily and monthly switches to SF Classic
⦁	Profiles and users that switched to SF Classic
⦁	Slowest desktop record pages
⦁	Browsers used to access Lightning Exp and SF mobile app
⦁	Pages viewed most often in Lightning Exp
⦁	Number of active users, featurs, and PS licenses

>System Overview for User Interface
Shows usage and limits

Sales Enablement
Is a process of education and guidance that gives members of sales team the skills and tools they need to succeed

Tech Debt
